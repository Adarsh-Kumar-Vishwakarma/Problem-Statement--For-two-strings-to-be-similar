# Problem-Statement--For-two-strings-to-be-similar


Problem Statement:

For two strings to be similar (Alike), each character in the first string must have a unique mapping to a character in the second string and vice versa. Specifically, no two different characters in first string can map to the same character in second string, and vice versa. A character may map to itself. If these conditions are fulfilled, return true, if not, return false.

Examples

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add" Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s="foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

Example 4:

Input: s = "badc", t = "baba"

Output: false in Java
